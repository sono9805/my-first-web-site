    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="sdsd">HTML</a> stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.

    HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
    <p></p>
    <img src="logo.webp" width="450">
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.

Prerequisites:	Basic computer literacy, basic software installed, basic knowledge of working with files, and HTML basics (study Introduction to HTML.)
Objective:	To learn what CSS is.
In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.

    This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript.
